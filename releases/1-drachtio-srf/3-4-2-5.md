Welcome to the Drachtio Signaling Resource framework (drachtio-srf), a module for building high-performance SIP server applications in pure javascript.

drachtio-srf requires a network connection to a drachtio server. The drachtio server provides the sip transaction processing engine and is controlled by nodejs applications using the drachtio-srf module.

drachtio-srf concerns itself solely with SIP signaling; however, a companion framework, drachtio-fsmrf, may be of interest to developers, as this framework allows the integration of media control (RTP) into SIP applications using Freeswitch as a media server.

API documentation for drachtio-srf can be found here.
